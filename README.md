QT Google Reader C++ Project

One of the teams in Raptor is creating a Java backend for monitoring RSS feeds. The goal is to create a desktop application using QT for displaying RSS feeds provided by the Java backend. The application is fetching the data with HTTP requests, then parse the JSON response and display the articles.
